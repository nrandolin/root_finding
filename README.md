## Applied Math: Assignment 01 - Root Finding

An assignment exploring root-finding methods, including a problem with predicting the collision of an egg when on a given trajectory.

## Root Finding


## Egg Collision
To run the collision prediction problem for a tumbling egg, run *egg.m*. Upon running this file, an animation of the egg collision plotting will be output, which will be saved as a video. If the user runs this file, they will need to change the file path noted in the function 
*animation* to a file path on their computer.
